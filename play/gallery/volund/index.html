                        This was my first Featured track, made for the 2nd round of the 4th Remix Contest,
                        and was a remix of Maple's track Blu. Of all the track's I've remixed, this was the
                        most enjoyable to remix. After I entered what I considered to be a failure of a
                        round 1 entry, I was determined to redeem myself. I guessed the track we were to
                        remix before the code was released, and got to brainstorming themes. Before long I
                        reduced my ideas to two; a track about magic and mages, or a track about Vikings. I
                        decided on the former. I found some great reference pictures from Deviantart to get
                        my imagination going, and drew some of the best stuff I had ever drawn at the time.
                        During the two week's we had to remix the track, I would have spent anywhere from
                        6-18 hours a day working on the track, talking about the track, finding pictures for
                        the track and playing the track. After this time I was severely burnt out, though
                        very proud of the final product. After a few days of deliberation, it was Featured,
                        and one of my biggest goals was accomplished. It is one of my favourite tracks to
                        have made, despite being 8 years old; the trackmaking process of Mage's Lair
                        will forever be a peak memory for me on this game.

                        This was my 2nd entry for the Official Contest, my first being an NTBF despite (in
                        hindsight) it being better than this track (this track would later become AMBITION).
                        After being dissatisfied with my first entry I decided to restart with a bit over a
                        month until the due date. School holidays had just started, and with little else to
                        do over a winter break, I spent two weeks straight working on it. I did most of the
                        track during this period, doing about 500kb-600kb of work in that amount of time (I
                        had a mantra during this time, ‘50k a day'). I then left the track for a while when
                        school started again, as I started to dislike where it was going; without being able
                        to detail cliffs effectively, I began to hate the track. With about a week until the
                        due date, I decided to try and finish it as best as I could and release it, as the
                        competition for the Official Contest died off and I really wanted a ribbon. I did
                        the last 200kb-300kb in that time, and although some of it was pretty empty, I
                        released and got a feature almost instantly (inside the first 10 minutes of its
                        release, I think) and pulled off 4th place (although if we went by Char's standings,
                        I would have finished 2nd lol) in the contest. Funnily enough, I predicted that I
                        would finish 4th 2 months beforehand. All in all, I have mixed feelings about this
                        track; on one hand I drew some really cool things in it, and came 4th in the first
                        Official Contest; on the other it is really rushed in some places and looks pretty
                        poor wherever the track isn't a forest.

                        After over 12 months without releasing a track, and thinking that I wouldn't finish
                        a track again, I finally did. After over a year of starting cool tracks and not
                        finishing them (a collab with TheSouthAmericanGuy called ‘Wild World', a massive
                        Mayan-themed track, and a collab with alexander, cky199 and mR..A) I finally
                        completed something. Ataraxy was, at first, something which I just experimented
                        with; I drew some islands and detailed them my own way, tried to figure out how to
                        detail rocks, stuff like that. After a while of doing this, I decided to see if I
                        could make a track inspired by the Air Nomads in the “Avatar” series, which I love.
                        I made a lot of progress at first, which was encouraging, as previously I hit a wall
                        quite soon. However, as I got two thirds of the way through and started the biggest
                        island, I hit a wall; again, I felt discouraged by my inability to detail cliffs and
                        rock faces well. I left it for a few days, then came back and eventually worked
                        through the slump to finish it. That large island took me close to 3 weeks, whereas
                        the rest of the track probably took me about 1-2 week/s. I'm glad I finished it, and
                        was able to overcome my burnout from the Official Contest.

                        Drawn for the super competitive first round of RC8, Temple of Time was
                        inspired by its namesake in the incredible Nintendo Switch game Zelda: Breath of the
                        Wild. Going into the competition, I wanted more than anything to draw something
                        based on the Zelda series, as a way of acknowledging the vast amounts of fun the
                        series has given me from all the way back to Links Awakening on the Gameboy Colour.
                        Although it was a big challenge to pull off, I think I did quite well and learnt a
                        lot about drawing in the process. More about the trackmaking process can be read in
                        this thread: <a href="https://community.freeriderhd.com/threads/temple-of-time.11211/"

                        different iterations, but
                        this is the one that I/we settled on in the end. Rationalities did the bulk of the
                        first 260kb, and I the last 260kb or so between September and October 2022. It was a
                        blast making this. This was my first release in 2 years, my first non-contest track
                        in 6 years, my first collab in 7 years, and my biggest track in 6 years; I'm
                        very proud of the track! For more info on this track, see the following thread: <a

                        <summary>Comment on Track</summary><br />From May 10, 2022 until September 24, 2023, if I was
                        drawing on FRHD, I was
                        drawing on AMBITION. This track met all my hopes and exceeded them. My goals were:
                        to surpass 1MB/1000kb for the first time; to use every vehicle and powerup for the
                        first time; to have a 3-5 minute long ride; to have a track that looked just as good
                        fully zoomed out as fully zoomed in; and to have a track that would be firmly placed
                        as one of the best releases on FRHD. I believe I achieved all I set out to do, and
                        more. This track is the product of hundreds of hours of meticulous drawing,
                        planning, testing and trial and error. I wanted to have a track that would be just
                        as incredible now, as in 10 years time; the way I perceive tracks like Subterra
                        Ulterior to be. This is my best track, and will likely be that way for good. I am
                        more than content with this, given the sheer quality and quantity of AMBITION. For
                        the first time, I feel that I've finally met - perhaps even exceeded - the
                        potential I first showed all those years ago. As a fun aside, finishing NOSTALGIA //
                        time's atrophy and AMBITION is the first time I've released more than 1
                        track in a 12-month span since 2016; a bit of a second wind in my trackmaking
                        &quot;career&quot;, perhaps!

                        <summary>Comment on Track</summary><br />Not too much to say about this track in all honesty! I
                        made Banther Lodge in
                        5 days for Remix Contest 9's first round. I had not planned to enter because
                        the original track did not suit my style at all, but in the end I had a weird spurt
                        of inspiration to compete in all three rounds, and thus wanted to release something
                        finished and polished. The focus was completely on detail rather than a theme, and I
                        think it shows; the detail in this track has some of my crispest detail to date. I
                        played around with a proper background, and experimented with the teleporter; all in
                        all, I'm really satisfied with this track. I made some references to The Dragon
                        Prince in this track, though had little time to expand on the theme. Ultimately, it
                        placed me third in RC9's first round with a 9.2/10, which for the time I spent
                        on the track, I'm super happy with.

                    Though that's all for now, stay tuned; there are more tracks to come from me! The goal is to
                    attain VIP status and at least 10 features. With this in mind, I have a lot of tracks planned for
                    the future: a collab with Stig, a collab with Coated_Badger, a collab with THEend, and a couple of
                    solo projects. Until then...<br />
