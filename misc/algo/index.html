        <p>This program uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithm</a> to design a two-dimensional car that is &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; for a particular terrain. The rules of the problem are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The car must have two wheels (blue circles) and two loads (red circles).</li>
        <li>The initial positions and radii of these four masses can be freely chosen by the algorithm.</li>
        <li>The masses are connected by springs whose length, damping constant and spring constant can be freely chosen by the algorithm.</li>
        <li>The loads must never touch the ground.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The optimality of a particular candidate solution (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function">fitness function</a>) is determined by how far it travels before <em>a)</em> a mass touches the ground or <em>b)</em> time runs out.</p>
        <p>Note that at the beginning, the algorithm doesn&rsquo;t even know that wheels belong on the bottom. It is sometimes possible to see distinct species emerge and die - for instance, &ldquo;unicycles&rdquo; are often quite successful in the early stages of the algorithm&rsquo;s progress.</p>
        <p>The graph shows mean and maximum fitness values as a function of generation number.</p>
        <p>This demo inspired <a href="http://boxcar2d.com/">Boxcar2D</a>.  Big shout out to <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> which is the mechanism by which this can run in your browser in 2023, nearly two decades after the code was originally written.</p>
        <p>The GA could converge much faster than it does here. In choosing the fitness cutoff, population size etc. I have aimed for an interesting/fun simulation rather than a fast, useful optimization.</p>
        <p>The timeout is fixed but arbitrary. It was a quick hack to remove solutions which get stuck without crashing.</p>
